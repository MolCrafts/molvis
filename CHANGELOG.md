# Changelog

All notable changes to MolVis are documented here. The whole repo is
version-locked to one tag, so this is the single changelog for the core
engine, the web page, the VSCode extension, and the Python package.

This file is the source of truth for the in-app "What's new" dialog — the
page reads it at build time (see `page/src/lib/changelog.ts`). Keep the
format below: `## [version] - date`, then `### Section` groups, then
`- bullet` items.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-07-04

### Core
- Bump `@molcrafts/molrs` to 0.6.0 — a wasm-bindgen bundler-target build (WASM
  auto-initializes on import) carrying the GRO/MOL2/POSCAR/TRR/XTC readers and
  binary writers the expanded IO relies on
- glTF/GLB export: `exportFrameToGLB` / `MolvisApp.exportGLTF` serialize the
  scene to a self-contained binary glTF of real ball-and-stick geometry —
  matte, element-coloured, split-coloured bonds, bond orders — viewable in any
  glTF viewer with zero MolVis runtime
- Data-source synthesis: scene-level composition (trajectory-unify, acquisition
  re-axis) replacing the CombineSystems node
- ComputeBonds modifier: dynamic distance / covalent bond perception, with
  unwrapped `xu`/`yu`/`zu` coordinate support
- Advanced reset camera: radius-aware, per-axis, OBB- and PBC-aware, with
  automatic view-direction selection
- Semi-headless `MolvisRenderer` facade (runs under a `NullEngine`)

### IO
- New writers: MOL2, CIF, Cube, GRO, POSCAR, DCD, TRR, XTC, plus export wiring
- New loaders: GROMACS, VASP, MOL2
- Per-element colours for XYZ files
- "Auto" load mode keeps topology when dropping a trajectory onto an open structure

### UI
- Soft Tableau default type colours with golden-angle overflow (vivid palette)
- Wireframe overlays for all molpack confinement regions
- Trajectory and view panel refinements

### VSCode
- Binary editor provider for molecular files
- Stream large trajectories instead of loading them whole

### Chore
- Charting extracted into the standalone `@molcrafts/molplot` package (Vega-Lite),
  now consumed as the published `@molcrafts/molplot@0.1.0` dependency
- Stop committing `package-lock.json`; CI resolves dependencies fresh

## [0.0.7] - 2026-05-30

### Core
- Bump @molcrafts/molrs to 0.0.14
- Model volumetric grids as blocks (Cube / CHGCAR readers)
- IO / overlay / runtime cleanup after core review

### UI
- Version badge in the top bar opens this changelog
- Translucent overlays no longer hide atoms underneath

## [0.0.6] - 2026-05-20

### Core
- Add repository / homepage / bugs metadata to package.json
- Core review remediation pass
